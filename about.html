              Nnedimma Ugochukwu is currently a junior at the University of Pittsburgh at Bradford majoring in Computer Information Systems and Technology (CIST) with a minor in Digital Graphic Design aspiring to one day help many others in their day to day lives.

                Her digital art fiasco all began back in 2006 when she joined an online community called IMVU to create visually compelling avatar profile pictures to show off to the IMVU community. After her days of IMVU ended, she took a very long hiatus from digital art, yet kept doing other art related projects ie. video editing and drawing to keep her busy.

              <p>
                It wasn't till college where she received formal education in using digital editing programs where she continued her dreams and aspirations in pursing art. Hoping that one day,she can use both her Digital Graphic Design and Computer Informations work fused into a future career.
                </p>
              <p>
                During her free time, she loves to go biking, write postcards, read manga, play the piano, take photos, and most importantly, travel. In the past year, she studied abroad in China for about a year and has visited over 7 countries and has plans for much much more.
              </p>
              <p>
                After graduation in 2018, she aspires to continue her travel adventures by spanning across Europe and Asia to see more than before. Along with that, possibly even pick up another language along the way.
